# Remote_Control_Home_Applyence

Now you can control electrical load unsing micro-controller 
Required parts 

1 Any Arduino Uno
2 Any Ir receiver 
3 Transformer 2 amp or heigher
4 Relay sheld 
5 ULN 2003
6 Voltage regulator
7 wire connector 

Every remote control transmit 4-8 bit data . In this project we decode that data using micro controller .
38kHz infrared (IR) rays generated by the remote control are received by any kind of IR receiver such as tv remote .
we decode remoite using micro controller viewed on serial monitor and noted signal emitted by remote . 
for decoding we use following program https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/examples/IRtest2/IRtest2.ino
